**Part 2: Simulate the following CPU scheduling algorithms**
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Preemptive Priority Scheduling
  - Round Robin (RR)

The task information will be read from an input file (input.txt) with the following format:
Pid, Arrival_Time, Burst_Time, Priority,

- Pid is a unique numeric process ID.
- Arrival_Time is the time when the task arrives.
- Burst_Time is the CPU time requested by a task.
- Priority is the priority associated with each task with low numbers representing high priority.
